Implement a design from scratch
In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. 
You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.
You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple:

Tasks
0. For this task, please write an amazing README.md

1. Header - Building a web page the right way, is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:
- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

2. 2. "What we do..." section
- Copy files from the previous task.
- For this second task: create the “What we do…” section
    In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: 
    holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.
-   Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some 
    components in next section.

3. "Our results" section
- Copy files from the previous task.
- For this third task: create the “Our results” section
- Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

4. Contact us
